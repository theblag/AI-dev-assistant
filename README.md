## What is QyverixAI?

Many beginners struggle with reading error messages, understanding what their code does, or knowing how to improve it. QyverixAI solves this with a clean workspace where you paste code and instantly get:

- A **plain-English explanation** - what the code does and why
- A **structured bug report** - what's wrong, which line, and how to fix it
- **Improvement suggestions** - style tips, best practices, and a quality score

No account required. No API key needed to get started. Fully open source.

```json
{
  "language": "Python",
  "summary": "This beginner-level Python snippet defines a reusable function...",
  "key_points": [
    "The code is written in Python with 2 lines.",
    "Defines 1 function: add.",
    "No loops or conditionals found."
  ],
  "complexity": "Beginner"
}
```

### `POST /debugging/`

Returns detected issues with line numbers and fix suggestions.

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "Hardcoded Secret",
      "line": 3,
      "description": "Hardcoded password found in code.",
      "suggestion": "Use environment variables: os.getenv('PASSWORD')",
      "severity": "error"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Found 1 issue. 1 error(s), 0 warning(s).",

      "example": "def greet(name: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Return a greeting string.\"\"\"",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "overall_score": 80,
  "next_step": "Great code! Consider adding tests next."
}
```

### `POST /analyze/`

All three analyses in one response.

## Deployment

### Render (Recommended - Free Tier)

1. Fork this repository
2. Connect it to [Render](https://render.com)
3. Use the `render.yaml` blueprint - one service, zero config
4. Your app will be live at `https://your-service.onrender.com`

The same service serves the frontend at `/app/` and the API from `/`.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t qyverixai .
docker run -p 8000:8000 qyverixai
```

---

## Optional: Live LLM Integration

QyverixAI works out of the box with its rule-based engine.
To enable richer AI-powered analysis, set these on your backend host:

```env
LLM_ENABLED=true
LLM_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Compatible with OpenAI, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

> ⚠️ Never commit API keys. Use environment variables or your host's secrets manager.
